<!-- The following questions are the things that we'll want to answer about each paper reporting a diagnostic. If you are ready to answer them now, please go ahead and interleave your answers with the prompts. If you are not ready, feel free to go ahead and create the issue now. -->

### Questions to answer about each paper:

* **1-2 sentences introducing study, main findings**
* **Study question(s) being investigated:** 
	* Is the study focused on diagnostics or treatments?
	If it is on therapeutics, use new-therapy-study-template instead.
	* What type of testing scenario is being considered?
	Is it a screening test (used for individuals with no symptoms), diagnostic test (used for individuals with symptoms), or definitive test (used for individuals who have had previous positive test results on diagnostic or screening tests)?
	* What reference test is considered as a "gold standard" comparator for the test under investigation?
* **Study population:**
  * What is the model system? (eg human study, animal model, cell line study etc)
  * What is the sample size? 
  * What is the "pre-test" probability of disease in the study population?
  Ie what is the anticipated prevalence of the disease?
  * For human studies, the following are related to the pre-test probability: 
	  * What countries/regions are considered?
	  * What is the age range, gender, other relevant characteristics?
	  * What is the setting of the study (eg random sample of school children, retirement communities etc)?
	  * What other specific inclusion-exclusion criteria are considered? 
* **Reference test:**
  * What reference test is considered to compare the new (index) test to?
* **Test assignment:**
	* How are the new and reference tests assigned?
	Examples of assignment could include: Recruited individuals have initially undergone neither the new nor the reference test; individuals tested as positive or negative by the reference test undergo the new test; individuals who have undertaken the new test are assessed by the standard test.
	* Provide other relevant details about the study design.
	Depending on how individuals are chosen, may be biasing towards more sick or less sick individuals or very clear-cut positive/negative cases.
* **Test conduct:**
  * Describe technical details of assays used, when measurements were taken and by whom etc for both the new and standard tests.
* **Assessment of test results:**
  * Describe how individuals are classified as positive or negative eg if a threshold is used.
  * Is the test precise/reproducible when repeated more than once?
	* Are measurements complete? 
	For example: Do some participants undergo just one test (the new or the reference test)?
	Are there individuals with inconclusive results?
* **Results summary:**
	* What are the estimate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predicted value (NPV)?
	Note that the PPV and NPV represent "post-test" probabilities of disease and are generally more meaningful than sensitivity and specificty.
	Sometimes the posttest odds will be given instead.
	* What are the confidence bounds around these intervals?
* **Interpretation of results for study population:**
	* How good is the test at ruling in or ruling out a disease based on the posttest probalities?
	* Are there identified side affects of the test?
	* Is patient adherence to the test likely to be an issue?
* **Extrapolation of conclusions to other groups of individuals not specifically included in the study?**
  * How well is the test likely to work in populations with different pretest odds?
  Eg if the prevalence is lower, the PPV will also be lower, but the NPV will be higher.
  * How costly is the test?
  * How difficult is it to perform the test in different settings?
  * Could the test be combined with other existing tests?
* **1-2 sentences on concluding remarks, including summary of strengths, weaknesses, limitations.**
