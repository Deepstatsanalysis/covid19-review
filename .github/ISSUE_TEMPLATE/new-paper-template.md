### Questions to answer about each paper:
* **1-2 sentences introducing study, main findings**
* **Study question(s) being investigated:** 
	* Is the study focused on diagnostics or treatments?
	* How many/what drugs/combinations are being considered?
	* What are the main hypotheses being tested?
* **Study population:**
	* What is the sample size?
	If multiple groups are considered, give it for each group eg number treated with treatment A, number treated with treatment B
	* For human studies: What countries/regions are considered?
	* For human studies: What is the age range, gender, other relevant characteristics?
	* For human studies: What is the setting of the study (eg random sample of school children, in-patients, out-patients etc)?
* **Treatment/test assignment:**
	* How are treatments and tests assigned?
	In other words, is it an interventional or an observational study?
	* Is the study randomized?
	(A study can be interventional but not randomized, eg a phase I or II clinical trial is
	interventional but not usually randomized.)
	* Provide other relevant details about the design.
	This includes possible treatment stratification (eg within litters for animal studies, within hospitals for human studies),
	possible confounding variables (eg having a large age range of individuals), possible risks of bias and how they are addressed
	(eg is there masking in a clinical trial? how are individuals chosen in an observational study?)
* **Outcome assessment:**
	* Describe the outcome that is assessed and whether it is appropriate.
	For example: Is the outcome assessed by a clinician or is it self-reported?
	Is the outcome based on viral load or a functional measurement (eg respiratory function, discharge from hospital)?
	How long after a treatment is the outcome measured?
	What method is used to measure the outcome?
	* Are outcome measurements complete? 
	For example: Is there a lot of loss-to-follow up? 
	* Are outcome measurements subject to various kinds of bias? (eg if there isn't masking in randomized trials)
* **Methods assessment:**
	* What methods are used for inference? (eg logistic regression, nonparametric methods etc)
	* Are the methods appropriate for the study? (eg are clustered data treated independently or are clustered adjusted for, such as different hospitals or litters)
	* Is there adjustment for possible confounders? (eg adjustment for age, sex, or comorbidities)
* **Results summary:**
	* What is the estimate association? (eg is it an estimated odds ratio, a median difference in detected cases etc)
	* Provide measures of confidence or statistical significance, if provided, such as confidence intervals, p-values, and/or Bayes factors.
* **Interpretation of results for study population:**
	* Can we make a causal interpretation for the individuals in the study of test/drug -> outcome? 
	Eg if it is a well-performed animal study or randomized trial you can generally infer causality.
	If is an observational study, does it match up with some of Bradford Hill criteria? https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/hill https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria
	* Are there identified side effects or interactions with other drugs?
	Eg is the treatment known to cause liver damage or to not be prescribed for individuals with certain comorbities?
	* Are there specific subgroups with different findings? 
	Eg do individuals with a specific baseline seem to do particularly well?
	(Careful about multiple testing trap here though!)
* **Extrapolation of conclusions to other groups of individuals not specifically included in the study?**
	* If the study is an animal study, that clearly comes with caveats.
	* If it is a human study, still need to think how results extrapolate to other groups.
	* Can results extrapolate easily to other similar groups? (eg same country, similar age groups)
	* What would happen if conditions are extended in terms of dose or duration?
	* Can results be extrapolated to other populations or in very different settings? (eg different age group, primary care setting vs emergency department etc)
* **1-2 sentences on concluding remarks, including summary of strengths, weaknesses, limitations.**
