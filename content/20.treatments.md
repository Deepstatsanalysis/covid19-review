## Therapeutics {.page_break_before} 

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individual‚Äôs immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30305-6]. 
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.  

### Treatment of Symptoms
The clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from being asymptomatic, going through mild symptoms, such as cough, sore throat and fever, to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure which can lead to death. The development and the approval of a vaccine against this new microbe will require at least a year. Afterwards, the vaccine will face another challenge. It will in fact need to be produced in vast quantities in order to be distributed to all countries, while many companies do not have such production capacity. While at the moment the most effective way to fight Corona virus is social distancing, scientist are also focusing on other ways to cure the infection. Currently, treatments are going in two different directions. On one side, efforts are focusing on the development of new drugs which can cure the symptoms. On the other side, scientist are testing new antivirals that can inhibit the virus amplification in human bodies. In this section we will describe and analyse the most recent developed drugs that are undergoing new trials, as well as  to face the Corona virus disease. 

Tocilizumab 

Background: A recent study carried out on a sample of 191 Covid-19 patients from Wuhan shows that the blood of patients who faced death contained about 74% more interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to the survivors (Zhou et al. 2020). This indicates an inflammatory response out of control or what is called ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù. In this context IL-6 plays a key role (Tisoncik et al. 2012). IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the family of interleukins, immune system regulators, primarily responsible for immune cell differentiation and activation. In a healthy situation the lung respiratory epithelium together with alveolar macrophages limits the activation of the immune system as well as the alveolar spaces, ensuring homeostasis. It has been already shown that high level of IL-6, during the infection of other Corona viruses (influenza, SARS COV), lead to the high concentration of other cytokines (TFN, IL-1ùõΩ) with the results of heavily damaging the endotelium of blood vessels and disrupting the balance between pro and anti-inflammatory response (Park et al. 2001). The holes generated allow not just for the passage of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes to the site of the infection but also the accumulation of liquids into the lungs, which is the ultimate cause of the death as per Acute Distress Respiratory Syndrome (ADRS) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Channappanavar and Perlman 2017), also caused by the new Corona virus . 

Recently Chinese and Italian doctors have found that the the Tocilizumab (acterma, by Roche), a drug commonly used in the rheumatoid artitis, is very effective in the cure of Covid-19 patients. Specifically, Tocilizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to the receptor of IL-6, de facto inhibiting the IL-6 immune cascade. Chinese doctors have started a trial enrolling 188 patients o which 14 with severe lung disease have shown clear sings of improvements, according to their results. Also, The AIFA (the Italian Drug Agency) approved the start of a new trial on March 19 recruiting patients at the initial stage of the infection. Together with these independent trials, Roche, also in collaboration with the FDA, will start a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial early April. The trial will enroll 330 patients globally, which will be followed for 60 days upon use of the drug via injection to analyse its efficiency/safety (Biopharma-reporter.com).
