## Therapeutics {.page_break_before} 

Given the rapid predicted spread of the disease, the development of therapeutics will be critical to mitigating its effect on health and the mortality rate.
Typically, therapeutics can take a few forms.
First, the treatment and reduction of symptoms can result in the reduction of the severity and risk associated with an active infection.
Second, the development of antiviral drugs can drive a reduced recovery time for patients by inhibiting the development of the virus once an individual is infected.
Finally, vaccines present a strategy for bolstering the immune response of the populus broadly to the virus, resulting in a lower rate of infection.
All three of these strategies have been valuable elements of responses to other viruses, including coronaviruses, and are being investigated by researchers at present.
Additionally, there have been suggestions within the scientific community that nutraceutical or dietary supplement interventions may prime an individual‚Äôs immune system to prevent or lessen the impact of RNA virus infections [@doi:10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007; @doi:10/ggkd3b]. 
In the following sections, we critically appraise the literature surrounding the repurposing of existing treatments and development of novel therapeutics for the prevention, mitigation, and treatment of coronavirus infections.  

### Treatment of Symptoms

The clinical picture of SARS-CoV-2 infection differs dramatically between individuals.
Some are asymptomatic.
Others experience mild COVID-19 symptoms, such as cough, sore throat and fever, while the most severe cases of COVID-19 include severe pneumonia with respiratory failure which can lead to death. 
Vaccines are one avenue to mitigate harm from viral pathogens, but in the case of a rapidly growing pandemic the longer timeframe of vaccine development and distribution means that there can be a key for treatments that palliate symptoms to avoid the most severe outcomes from infection. 
Afterwards, the vaccine will face another challenge. 
While at the moment the most effective way to fight Corona virus is social distancing, scientist are also focusing on other ways to cure the infection. 
Currently, treatments are going in two different directions.
On one side, efforts are focusing on the development of new drugs which can cure the symptoms.
On the other side, scientist are testing new antivirals that can inhibit the virus amplification in human bodies. 
In this section we will describe and analyse the most recent developed drugs that are undergoing new trials, as well as  to face the Corona virus disease. 

#### Tocilizumab

A recent study carried out on a sample of 191 Covid-19 patients from Wuhan shows that the blood of patients who faced death contained about 74% more interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared to the survivors [@doi:ggnxb3].
This indicates an inflammatory response out of control or what is called ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù.
In this context IL-6 plays a key role [@doi:10.1128/mmbr.05015-11].
IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the family of interleukins, immune system regulators, primarily responsible for immune cell differentiation and activation.
Interleukins can regulate both pro- and anti-inflammatory response.
In this context, severe lung infection reflects the over-production of proinflammatory interleukins. 
In a healthy situation the lung respiratory epithelium together with alveolar macrophages limits the activation of the immune system as well as the alveolar spaces, ensuring homeostasis.
It has been already shown that high level of IL-6, during the infection of other Corona viruses (influenza, SARS COV), lead to the high concentration of other cytokines, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and IL-1ùõΩ. These cytokines enhance the pro-inflammatory reaction by increase acute-phase signaling, trafficking of immune cells to the site of primary infection, epithelial cell activation, and secondary cytokine production.
The acute phase response to infection results in the heavily damage of the endotelium of blood vessels, which disrupts the balance between pro and anti-inflammatory response [@doi:10.1164/ajrccm.164.10.2104013].
Thus, the holes generated allow not just for the passage of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes to the site of the infection but also the accumulation of liquids into the lungs, which is the ultimate cause of the death as per Acute Distress Respiratory Syndrome (ADRS) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [@doi:10.1007/s00281-017-0629-x], also caused by the new coronavirus. 
Recently Chinese and Italian doctors have found that the the Tocilizumab (actemra, by Roche), a drug commonly used in the rheumatoid arthritis, may palliate the most severe symptoms associated with COVID-19. 

##### Anticipated Mechanism 

Specifically, Tocilizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to the receptor of IL-6, de facto inhibiting the IL-6 immune cascade. 

##### Current Evidence

Chinese doctors have started a trial enrolling 188 patients of which 14 with severe lung disease have shown clear sings of improvements, according to their results. 
Also, The AIFA (the Italian Drug Agency) approved the start of a new trial on March 19 recruiting patients at the initial stage of the infection. 
Together with these independent trials, Roche, also in collaboration with the FDA, will start a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial early April. 
The trial will enroll 330 patients globally, which will be followed for 60 days upon use of the drug via injection to analyse its efficiency/safety (Biopharma-reporter.com).
However, previous studies on RA showed that in patients treated with TCZ the rate of incident infections in clinical practice patients was higher than the one observed during clinical trial [@doi:10.1093/rheumatology/ker223]. 
Also, RA patients with chronic hepatitis B (HB) infection showed high risk of HB virus reactivation upon TCZ administration in combination with other RA drugs [@doi:10.1111/1756-185X.13010]. 
These last findings highlight the need to search for a balance between impairing a harmful immune response, such as the one generated by the cytokine storm, and preventing the worsening of the clinical picture of the patients by potential new viral infections. 
This aspect is probably crucial to be investigated further in the trials that are about to start. 
Perhaps, the TCZ treatment would best suit patients with severely compromised lungs due to the Covid-19 infection and are therefore at greater risk of death, in order to stop the uncontrolled immune response before it‚Äôs too late.

### Small Molecule Drugs for COVID-19

The replication cycle of a virus within an epithelial host cell includes 6 basic steps which can be shortly summarised as follow: i) attachment of the virus to the host cell; ii) penetration by endocytosis; iii) uncoating, classically defined as the release of viral contents into the host cell; iv) biosynthesis, during which the viral genetic material enters the nucleus where it gets replicated; v) assembly, where viral proteins are translated and new viral particles are assembled; vi) release, when the new viruses are released into the extracellular environment [@isbn:978-1405136457]. 
Antiviral drugs do not kill the virus, rather they inhibit its amplification by impairing one of these steps. 
Nowadays, many of these drugs act during the biosynthesis step in order to inhibit the virus‚Äô genetic material replication.
Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus. 
Differently from a DNA virus, which can use the host enzymes to propagate itself, RNA viruses depends on their own polymerase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in order to be replicated [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7; @doi:10.1002/jmv.25761].

#### Nucleotide Analogs

Why one might use nucleotide analogs.

##### Avigan

Avigan (Flavipiravir, from Toyama chemical Fujifilm) is a drug which has been found effective to block viral amplification in the Influenza virus infection. 
Specifically, Avigan is a nucleoside precursor efficiently recognised as guanosine and adenosine analogue by the virus polymerase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). 
While a single incorporation does not influence RNA transcription, multiple events of incorporation lead to the arrest of RNA synthesis [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068347].
Importantly It was already shown that Avigan is able to give 100% coverage against the Ebola virus in mice [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0]. 
Furthermore, there are evidences that drug might also work against Corona virus infection. 
For instance, a recent study showed its effectiveness compared to other antivirals such as lopinavir and ritonavir. 
The drug was tested on a sample of 80 patients (35 experimental sample, 45 control group) and increased the speed of recovery (measured as viral clearance from the patient by RT-PCR) of about 4 days, compared to the control sample treated with the other anti-virals, such as Lopinavir and Ritonavir. 
Also lung body scan seem to look better in about 91% of the patients analysed [@doi:10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007]. 
However, the size of the sample is too small to give a powerful statistics, as well as the choice of the patients did not take into consideration important factors such as previous clinical conditions, sex, while there was no age categorisation.

##### Remdesivir

Remdesivir (Gilead) is an adenosine analogue which once incorporated into the nascent viral chain causes premature termination of transcription [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].
Remdesivir acts at early stage of infection. 
Previous works already showed that Remdesivir was effective in the treatment of Covid-19 similar viral pathogens, such as SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, in animal models, while a recent study showed that Remdesivir resulted in 100% protection against the Ebola virus in human liver Cancer cell line, which is also sensitive to the novel Corona virus [@doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0]. 
Upon FDA approval Gilead enrolled about a 1000 patients from COVID-19 hit countries for two phase III clinical trials to test the efficacy of the drug in adults. 
Specifically, one trial will test 400 patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms, while the second trial will randomise the remaining amount of patients with mild symptoms. 
In both studies, patients will receive the same Remdesivir dose for 10 days (Gilead.com). 
Remdesivir is also currently involved in a trial to test the drug against Ebola virus since 2015. 
However, in August 2019, after a large phase III trial in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the drug was declared to be less effective compared to other monoclonal antibody in use (Biopharmadive.com).

#### Antibodies

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the way we treat human diseases. 
As a result, they have become one of the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market in recent years [@doi: 10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z].
There are currently 79 FDA approved mAbs on the market including antibodies for viral infections (e.g. Ibalizumab for HIV and Palivizumab for RSV) [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; @doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095916].
Although vaccines remain the most important way to treat viral infections, their development process is long and they fail to provide immediate prophylactic protection or treat ongoing infections [@doi:10.3390/v10120680].
For that reason, neutralizing antibodies have emerged to address these shortcomings.
Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies commonly target viral surface glycoproteins or host structures, thereby inhibiting viral entry [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2017.02323; @doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1337614].
This section discusses current efforts in developing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and how expertise gained from previous approaches for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV may benefit antibody development.

#### Interferons

Interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines crucial to activate the first (innate) immune system response against viral infections. 
Interferons are classified into three categories based on their receptor specificity: type I, II and III [@doi:10.1128/mmbr.05015-11]. 
Specifically, IFNs I (IFN-ùõº and ùõΩ) and II (IFN-ùõæ ) induce the expression of antiviral proteins which bring the viral RNA to degradation [@doi:10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.013]. 
Among these IFNs, IFN- ùõΩ was already found to strongly inhibit the replication of other corona viruses, such as SARS-Cov, in cell culture, while IFN-ùõº and ùõæ were shown to be less effective in this context [@doi:10.1016/j.jcv.2003.11.013]. 
There are evidences that patients with higher susceptibility to develop Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) show indeed deficiency of IFN- ùõΩ. 
For instance, upon other Corona viruses infection IFN- ùõΩ expression and synthesis is impaired, so that the virus can in fact escape the innate immune response [@doi:10.1016/j.virusres.2014.07.024]. 

On March 18 2020 Synairgen plc has received approval to start a phase II trial for SNG001, an IFN- ùõΩ-1a formulation to be delivered to lungs via inhalation. 
SNG001 was already shown to be effective reducing viral load in swine flu in vivo model, as well as it has been shown to be effective in the protection from other Corona virus infection in vitro (Synairgen plc, press release).
