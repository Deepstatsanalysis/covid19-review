## Abstract {.page_break_before} 
Since late 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world, resulting in the
declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). This infectious disease is caused
by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Research on
the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the diease it causes is emerging rapidly through global scientific efforts.
This information will be critical to effort to mitigate the impact of the virus through the
Here we present a collaborative effort to organize and
consolidate the rapidly emerging scientific literature related to SARS-CoV-2. We present information
about the virus in the context of what is known about related viruses and synthesize studies
emerging about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 alongside literature about related illnesses.
A broad scientific effort to understand this pandemic and related viruses and diseases will be
foundational to efforts to predict possible interventions. This text is an evolving and
collaborative document that seeks to incorporate the ever-expanding body of information related to
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
