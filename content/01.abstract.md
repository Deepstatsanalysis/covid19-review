## Abstract {.page_break_before} The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since late 2019, this infectious disease has
spread around the world, resulting in the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization
(WHO). Research on the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the diease it causes is emerging rapidly, and this
information will be critical to identifying strategies to mitigate the impact of the virus in the
coming months. Here we present a collaborative effort to organize and consolidate the rapidly
emerging scientific information available about SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses as well as the
diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 and related illnesses. A broad scientific effort to characterize
the virus and disease in order to predict possible interventions will be instrumental in efforts to
control the effects of the diease worldwide; an important component of these efforts is the rapid
consolidatation of the information available.
