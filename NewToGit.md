# New to Git and GitHub?

## What is Git?

Have you ever frantically edited a paper, then realized you liked your original version better?
Git is a tool that allows you to track all the changes made to a document over time.
Have you ever been writing something as a team and found that someone was editing an old version of the document?
Git tracks different people's contributions and manages how they get merged together to avoid the headache of figuring out what changed when.

We are managing this project through GitHub with the goal of a) allowing for the manuscript to evolve rapidly as new information comes out, and b) give everyone credit for their attributions.
While we believe this is a great tool, we know it can sometimes be intimidating to get started. 
We don't want the medium to turn anyone away from contributing, so please let us know if you're having problems.

## Most Important: Make a GitHub account

GitHub is an online platform that visualizes changes made with git (think of a really elegant "Track Changes").
You can make an account [here](https://github.com/).
As long as you do this first step of making a GitHub account, you will always be able to open an issue to ask us for help!

## GitHub Vocabulary

- [Repository](http://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review): 
The set of files, issue tracker issues, etc. related to this manuscript 
- [Issue](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/issues): 
The ticketing system for GitHub. 
A ticket can be a question, concern, problem, bug, or anything else you want to bring to the attention of the people working on a repository.
Here, we will use tickets not only for problems or questions, but also to gather papers and preprints that come out about diagnostics and therapeutics related to COVID-19
- Issue Template: 
A way of pre-specifying what an "issue" should look like to be useful. 
We haven't built these yet, but as the project progresses we'll get an idea of what's helpful. 
For now, just try to explain why you're opening the issue (e.g., "I was doing X and ran into problem Y", or "I saw the paper linked here and thought it might be interesting for X reason") 
- [Manuscript Source]( https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/tree/master/content): 
The files that comprise the manuscript. 
Right now there's not much here, but we're working on it! 
These are written in a language called ["markdown"](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists) which is essentially plain text (thankfully!) 
We have separate a file for each section of the manuscript (Introduction, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics right now).
- Pull Request: If you want to contribute text, you should look in the [Manuscript Source]( https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/tree/master/content) for the file you want to edit (for example, the [Abstract](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/blob/master/content/01.abstract.md)). Click the edit button, which looks like a pencil in the upper right corner. Make any desired changes and then scroll down to the bottom. There you will see a box that says "Commit Changes." Give your submission a title and then briefly summarize your changes. Then you should click the box that says "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request." This will submit a request to add your changes to the underlying document. This will notify us to integrate your text into the document!
